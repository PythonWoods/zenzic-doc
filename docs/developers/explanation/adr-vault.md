# ADR Vault

> *"A tool that works for mysterious reasons is not a tool — it is a ritual.
> Zenzic works for documented reasons. This vault is the proof."*

This page is the complete index of **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** for
the Zenzic project. Each ADR documents a major technical decision: its context
(why the problem existed), its decision (what was chosen), and its invariants
(what must never change as a consequence).

For day-to-day contribution flow, release checks, and governance enforcement,
follow the operational runbook instead:

- [Developer Release and Governance Protocol](../how-to/release-governance-protocol.md)

ADRs are the **immutable memory** of the project. They explain not only what
Zenzic does, but why. Operational behavior at commit and push time is governed
by the Developer Release and Governance Protocol.

## Genesis Decisions

These ADRs define the philosophical and technical foundations on which all
subsequent decisions rest.

| ADR | Title |
|-----|-------|
| [ADR 001](./adr-lint-source.md) | Lint the Source, Not the Build |
| ADR 002 | Zero Subprocesses Policy *(Maintainer Only)* |

---

## Core Architecture Decisions

These ADRs document the structural decisions for the current architecture.

| ADR | Title |
|-----|-------|
| [ADR 003](./adr-discovery.md) | Root Discovery Protocol |
| [ADR 004](./adr-decentralized-cli.md) | Decentralized CLI Package |
| [ADR 005](./adr-agnostic-universalism.md) | Z404 Agnostic Universalism |
| ADR 007 | Sovereign Sandbox *(Maintainer Only)* |
| [ADR 008](./adr-bilingual-structural.md) | Bilingual Structural Invariant |
| [ADR 009](./adr-path-sovereignty.md) | Path Sovereignty |
| [ADR 013](./adr-regex-acl.md) | The Regex Anti-Corruption Layer (ReDoS Protection) |
| [ADR 015](./adr-native-telemetry.md) | Native Telemetry Validation |
| [ADR 020](./adr-parallel-early-termination.md) | Parallel Audit Completeness vs. Fail-Fast |

## Documentation Site Decisions

These ADRs document architectural decisions specific to this documentation site
(`zenzic.dev`) — choices about how the Docusaurus site is built, localized, and
maintained.

| ADR | Title |
|-----|-------|
| [ADR 006](./adr-unified-perimeter.md) | Unified Scan Scope (Storage + Blog) |

## Reading Guide

Each ADR follows a consistent structure:

- **Context** — the problem that existed before the decision was made. Reading

  the Context of an ADR tells you what pain the decision was eliminating.

- **Decision** — the choice that was made, stated precisely and without

  ambiguity. If you ever wonder "why does Zenzic do X?", the Decision section
  of the relevant ADR is the answer.

- **Rationale** — the engineering reasoning behind the decision. This section

  is the "why not the alternative?" — it records the rejected approaches and
  explains why they were insufficient.

- **Invariants** — the constraints that must never be violated as a consequence

  of the decision. These are permanent. They do not expire with version
  increments. A PR that violates an invariant listed in an ADR is an automatic
  revert candidate, regardless of its other merits.

- **Consequences** — the known trade-offs and capabilities that the decision

  enables or forecloses. Reading Consequences helps contributors understand the
  boundaries of what Zenzic can and cannot do by design.
