# Core Mechanics

Zenzic's validation engine relies on several fundamental architectures to guarantee deterministic, zero-false-positive results without executing a full site build.

## The Virtual Site Map (VSM) {#vsm}

When Zenzic validates your links, it does not simply check whether a target file exists on disk. Instead, it builds a **Virtual Site Map (VSM)** — a pure in-memory projection of what your build engine will actually serve to readers.

The VSM maps every canonical URL to a **Route** entry:

| Field | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `url` | The URL a browser would request, e.g. `/guide/install/` |
| `source` | The source file that produces this URL, e.g. `guide/install.md` |
| `status` | Whether the page is reachable, orphaned, ignored, or in conflict |
| `anchors` | Heading anchors pre-computed from the source file |

Each route carries a status that tells Zenzic how to treat links pointing to it:

| Status | Meaning | Link result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `REACHABLE` | Page is listed in navigation or is a locale route | Valid |
| `ORPHAN_BUT_EXISTING` | File exists on disk but is not in site navigation | Z103 error |
| `IGNORED` | Excluded by configuration (e.g. README files, private directories) | Z101 error |
| `CONFLICT` | Two source files produce the same canonical URL | Z101 error |

**Why this matters:** A file can exist on your filesystem and still be `IGNORED` in the VSM. A URL can be `REACHABLE` in the VSM without having a corresponding file on disk (for example, locale index routes). The VSM is the authority — Zenzic checks reachability, not just file existence.

This design means that `zenzic check links` catches problems that a naive file-existence check would miss: pages removed from navigation, conflicting routes, and orphaned content that readers cannot discover through normal browsing.

## The credential scanner Architecture

The Zenzic credential scanner uses a **dual-stream architecture** to ensure that no part of a file escapes credential scanning.

When the Reference Scanner processes a file, it creates two independent streams:

    classDef file    fill:#0f172a,stroke:#38bdf8,stroke-width:2px,color:#e2e8f0
    classDef credentials fill:#0f172a,stroke:#ef4444,stroke-width:2px,color:#e2e8f0
    classDef content fill:#0f172a,stroke:#7c3aed,stroke-width:2px,color:#e2e8f0

    disk["📄 File on disk"]:::file

    subgraph RS ["Reference Scanner"]
        CRED["🛡️ CREDENTIAL SCANNER stream\nSees ALL lines\n(incl. YAML frontmatter)"]:::credentials
        CT["📝 CONTENT stream\nSkips frontmatter + fenced blocks\n(parses references & images)"]:::content
    end

    disk --> CRED
    disk --> CT
```

The two streams have opposite filtering rules by design. The Content stream must skip YAML frontmatter to avoid parsing metadata like `author: Jane Doe` as a broken reference definition. The credential scanner stream must see frontmatter because a key like `aws_key: AKIA...` hiding in YAML metadata is a real secret that must be caught. The streams never share a data source — merging them would create a blind spot.

**Pre-Scan Normalizer.** Before running detection patterns, the credential scanner normalises each line to defeat obfuscation. Inline code backticks are unwrapped, concatenation operators are removed, and table pipe characters are collapsed. This means a secret broken across Markdown table columns — such as an AWS key split into `` `AKIA` + `suffix` `` — is reassembled before scanning. Both the raw and normalised forms are checked, and a deduplication set prevents double-reporting.

**ReDoS Protection.** Custom regex patterns declared in `[[custom_rules]]` are compiled through RE2 compatibility gates at load time. Unsupported constructs (for example backreferences or lookarounds) are rejected before any scan begins. Separately, the parallel worker watchdog still emits `Z902: RULE_TIMEOUT` if a worker stalls at runtime because of a systemic hang (for example I/O or coordinator starvation) rather than a regex backtracking canary.

## Circular Links as Knowledge Graphs

Documentation is a **Knowledge Graph** — a densely interconnected network where cross-linking between pages is expected and desirable. If a Tutorial links a Reference page for technical details, it is natural and beneficial for that Reference page to link back to the Tutorial as a working example. Circular link patterns are therefore structural data points, not defects.

Cycle detection is computed once with iterative DFS during resolver construction (Pass 1.5, Θ(V+E)). Every Pass 2 membership lookup against the cycle registry is O(1).

**Why the engine computes cycles at all.** The DFS traversal is a mechanical requirement of the Virtual Site Map builder: without identifying cycles, the recursive graph walk would loop infinitely. Detection is necessary to make the resolver terminate — it is not triggered by a quality concern.

## Three-Pass Reference Pipeline

To ensure accurate link validation that supports out-of-order reference definitions, Zenzic executes a strict Three-Pass Pipeline:

| Pass | Name | What happens |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Harvest** | Streams every line; records `[id]: url` definitions; runs the credential scanner on every URL and line |
| 2 | **Cross-Check** | Resolves every `[text][id]` usage against the complete `ReferenceMap`; flags unresolvable IDs |
| 3 | **Integrity Report** | Computes per-file integrity score; appends Dead Definition and alt-text warnings |

Pass 2 always runs after Pass 1 harvest completion. Security findings from Pass 1 affect exit semantics (exit code 2) but do not skip Pass 2 cross-check.
