# Configuration Strategy

This page is a troubleshooting guide for the most common configuration problems. For the full configuration model — file precedence, field definitions, and defaults — see [Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration-reference.md).

---

> **Two-file model summary:** `.zenzic.toml` holds shared project defaults; `.zenzic.local.toml` holds machine-local overrides and is not committed. Scalar fields follow last-write-wins. List fields (`forbidden_patterns`, `excluded_dirs`) are additive.

---

## Troubleshooting Matrix

### External link check is slow or needs suppression

External link validation only runs when `--strict` is passed. Omitting the flag disables all network requests entirely.
To permanently suppress specific URLs without removing strict mode, add their prefixes to `excluded_external_urls` in `.zenzic.toml`:

```toml title=".zenzic.toml"
excluded_external_urls = [
    "https://internal.company.com",
    "https://github.com/MyOrg/private-repo",
]
```

---

### `zenzic:ignore` does not suppress a Z2xx finding

Z2xx codes (`Z201`, `Z202`, `Z203`, `Z204`) are **non-suppressible**. They bypass the
suppression system entirely. The `zenzic:ignore` directive has no effect on these codes.

**Resolution:** Remove the content that triggers the finding. There is no configuration
flag to disable Z2xx rules.

---

### Forbidden pattern declared in `.zenzic.local.toml` is not detected

Possible causes:

| Cause | Diagnostic | Fix |
|:------|:-----------|:----|
| File not found | `zenzic config show` → check `forbidden_patterns` list | Verify path: `.zenzic.local.toml` must be in the repo root |
| Pattern uses PCRE syntax | Pattern silently not matched | Use RE2 DFA syntax. Lookaheads and backreferences are not supported |
| File is git-ignored and not present in CI | Z204 only fires locally | Provision patterns via CI secret (see [Privacy Gate](./configure-privacy-gate.md)) |

---

### Files that should be excluded are still scanned

`excluded_dirs` and `excluded_file_patterns` in `.zenzic.toml` apply only to documentation
source files. They do not interact with `.gitignore`.

**System-excluded paths** (never need to be declared):
- Build output: `build/`, `dist/`, `temp/`, `tmp/`, `.tox/`, `mutants/`
- Toolchain: `.git/`, `.venv/`, `node_modules/`
- Config files: `*.toml`, `*.yaml`, `*.json`, `*.lock`, `Makefile`, `justfile`

Only repo-specific entries not in the system exclusion list belong in `excluded_dirs`.

---

### `fail_under` threshold not respected

`fail_under` applies to the **Documentation Quality Score (DQS)**, not to individual
finding counts. A score of 0 from the Security Override (Z2xx present) always exits 2
regardless of `fail_under`.

Verify the effective threshold:

```bash
zenzic config show | grep fail_under
```

---

### Score is 0 but no credentials are present

Z204 (`FORBIDDEN_TERM`) also triggers the Security Override. Run:

```bash
zenzic check all --verbose
```

Look for `Z204` in the output. If `forbidden_patterns` in `.zenzic.local.toml` matches
content in your documentation, the score collapses to 0.

---

### Local override not applied in CI

`.zenzic.local.toml` is git-ignored and not present in CI checkouts by default.
This is expected. To apply overrides in CI, write the file from a secret before running Zenzic:

```yaml
- name: Write local zenzic overlay
  env:
    FORBIDDEN: ${{ secrets.ZENZIC_FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS }}
  run: printf '[governance]\nforbidden_patterns = %s\n' "$FORBIDDEN" > .zenzic.local.toml
```

---

### Disable network cache in ephemeral environments

Zenzic caches external link responses for 24 hours by default. In highly ephemeral environments (like certain Dockerized CI pipelines) where persisting `.zenzic_cache/` between runs is impossible or undesirable, you can disable the cache entirely to force synchronous network validation on every run.

```toml title=".zenzic.toml"
[network]
cache_ttl_hours = 0
```
