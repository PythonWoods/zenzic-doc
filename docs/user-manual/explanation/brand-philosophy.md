# Brand Philosophy

The Zenzic Brand Ecosystem defines how Zenzic is represented across open-source communities, CI/CD integrations, and documentation landscapes.

## Our Posture

Zenzic is an authoritative, silent, and rigorous entity. Our branding reflects the philosophy of the tool itself:

* **Surgical precision:** We prefer exact, technical language over vague marketing buzzwords.
* **Zero noise:** Just like Zenzic returns exit code `0` silently when a test passes, our visual and written communication avoids unnecessary clutter.
* **Deterministic tone:** Behavior is stated in precise, verifiable terms.

## The Zenzic Lexicon

Consistency is the foundation of quality. When writing about Zenzic across any medium, adhere to the following naming conventions:

* **Zenzic**: The software suite. Always written with a capital Z.
* **`zenzic`**: The CLI command. Always written in lowercase and formatted as code.
* **The credential scanner**: Our security scanning engine. Always capitalized.
* **Reference Integrity Check**: Our primary deterministic validation algorithm.

*What we are not:* Zenzic is an engine-agnostic quality suite. Never refer to Zenzic as simply a "plugin," a "MkDocs utility," or a "Markdown viewer."

## Visual Identity: The Zenzic Artifact

The historical term *zenzic* refers to the mathematical square of a number ($x^2$). It is fundamentally tied to root systems and dimensional scaling.

Our iconography directly inherits from this heritage. The visual artifact of Zenzic represents a solid root foundation holding complex mathematical structures in balance. It stands for logic dominating chaos across interconnected systems.

When positioning our logos or visual elements in presentations or documentation:

* Provide adequate whitespace around the artifact. Do not crowd it.
* Maintain sharp, high-contrast boundaries.
* Avoid skewing, rotating, or applying blur effects that disrupt its mathematical geometry.

## The Bimodal Palette {#bimodal-palette}

Zenzic adapts its visual frequency to the ambient light of the engineer's environment. The Indigo that guides you through a midnight audit must be different from the Indigo that greets you on a bright conference screen. This is not inconsistency — it is ergonomic design.

| Mode | Token | Hex | Contrast Ratio | WCAG Level |
|------|-------|-----|---------------|------------|
| Light | `indigo-700` | `#4338ca` | 7.9:1 on white | AAA |
| Dark | `indigo-300` | `#a8b3fb` | 9.9:1 on `#09090b` | AAA |
| Borders (Light) | `indigo-200` | `#c7d2fe` | structural | — |
| Borders (Dark) | `indigo-500/20` | `#6366f1` at 20% | structural | — |

**Usage Specification:** The Zenzic Indigo color is a semantic indicator reserved for structural components (e.g., Navbar, Footer, Scanner Output). In Light Mode, it ensures a contrast ratio >4.5:1 for primary text. In Dark Mode, contrast levels are recalibrated for extended readability. The `backdrop-blur` layer beneath `ZenzicTerminal` panels reduces border intensity to prevent visual fatigue (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance).
